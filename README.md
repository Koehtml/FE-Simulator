This is a Python-based practice software that simulates the NCEES FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) Civil Exam environment. This application helps engineering students prepare for their FE exam by providing a similar interface and practice problems.

## Features

- Computer-based testing interface similar to the actual NCEES FE Exam
- Practice problems across different engineering disciplines
- Timer functionality
- Problem navigation

## Setup and How to Use

NOTE: BEFORE TAKING AN EXAM, SEE THE FAQ BELOW. 

1. Download all files from Github (find the blue "<> Code" button on this page: https://github.com/Koehtml/FE-Simulator/tree/main and click "download ZIP").
2. Go to the downloads folder and open the folder "FE-Simulator-main" (you don't have to extract the zip folder).
3. Navigate to the "dist" folder
4. Click on the application file (It should have a little wide-flange beam icon.)
5. Windows Defender might pop up saying "Windows protected your PC". Click "More info" and click "Run anyway". 
  (If you don't feel comfortable running my software because of this, no pressure. You don't have to use it. 
  You can just click "Don't run" and ignore the rest of the steps.)
6. If you're still want to try it, click "Run Anyway".
7. The Dashboard will show up. Here you can see your exam results and choose your test settings (i.e. timed vs untimed test, number of questions, which categories)
8. Once you're ready, click "Take Practice Exam" and you're off to the races.

## FAQ

1. I want the Reference Manual to show up on the left where it says "Click here to load a PDF file". How do I do that?
   
If you want the Reference Manual to show up, go to the NCEES website (https://help.ncees.org/article/87-ncees-exam-reference-handbooks), log in to your MyNCEES account, and download the latest Reference Manual.
Next, go to the Simulator, click on the PDF window, and navigate on your computer to the Reference Manual PDF. It should then show up in the Simulator.

2. What are the controls in the PDF viewer?
   
Scroll up and down goes from one page to the next.
Ctrl + scroll up or down zooms in and out respectively.
Pressing down on the scroll wheel allows users to pan around a page.
Ctrl + F allows you to search for a word or phrase.

3. How many problems are there and are they randomized?

There are 50 problems and yes, all of the problems are randomized each time you begin a practice exam.

4. Will you be making more problems?

Yes! I want to create more problems so that users can take "full" practice exams with 110 questions.

5. Do you need help with developement?

Yes please so badly. It's literally just me and my friend making this and he isn't even a civil engineer. If you find it within your heart to work for free (not forever) for a while (but also to help more and more engineers pass their FE Exam), then reach out to me either on LinkedIn or Reddit. I'm fairly active on r/FE_Exam. Any little bit helps!!
